# Predicting-NFL-Play-Yardage

- Designed and implemented a predictive model using Python and machine learning libraries (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn) in Google Colab to forecast NFL play yardage based on 2021 and 2022 season data.
- Performed comprehensive data preprocessing, including feature engineering, data cleaning, and one-hot encoding to optimize the dataset for machine learning analysis.
- Evaluated multiple regression algorithms (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree, Random Forest), optimizing the Random Forest model through hyperparameter tuning for enhanced accuracy.
- Analyzed model performance using RMSE, employing learning curves to identify and mitigate overfitting, resulting in robust predictions of yards gained per NFL play.
- Visualized data insights and model accuracy improvements, demonstrating effective use of data science techniques in sports analytics.
